1. Moved index.html from client/src directory to the root directory. Think this
  may have something to do with the webpack default config from tutorial and the output path?
  
2. Downloaded and install babel-preset-stage-1 and added a .babelrc file per tutorial... may not be needed

3. Webpack file has been completely commented out. Added tutorial settings instead

4. Removed all styling from index.css and from the landingPage css file due to errors in webpack?

5. Need to add jsx extensions to components in Auth folder. Jsx isn't catching all linting errors...

6. Need to fix the authReducer and index.js file in reducer folder to get app to load properly
  For now, just duplicated the content of both files to get it to work
